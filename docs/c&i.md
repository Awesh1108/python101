compiler:-
 * Compiler Takes Entire program as input
 * intermediate Object Code is Generated
 * Conditional Control Statements are Executes faster
 * Memory Requirement : More (Since Object Code is Generated)
 * Program need not be compiled every time
 * Errors are displayed after entire program is checked
 * C Compiler

Interpreter:-
 * Interpreter Takes Single instruction as input .
 * No Intermediate Object Code is Generated
 * Conditional Control Statements are Executes slower
 * Memory Requirement is Less
 * Every time higher level program is converted into lower level program
 * Errors are displayed for every instruction interpreted (if any)
 * Python
